*.logCategory,Item,What it is & Why it's ignored
Python,venv/,Your Virtual Environment. This contains a copy of the Python interpreter and all installed libraries. It's huge and can be easily recreated by others using a requirements.txt file.
Python,__pycache__/,Auto-generated folders where Python stores compiled bytecode (.pyc files) to make your code run faster. These are machine-specific and don't belong in version control.
Node.js,node_modules/,"The folder where npm or yarn installs all your JavaScript dependencies. Like venv, it is massive and should be recreated by others using npm install."
OS Files,.DS_Store,A hidden file created by macOS Finder to store folder display settings (like icon positions). It's useless to anyone not on your specific Mac.
OS Files,Thumbs.db,The Windows version of .DS_Store. it stores cached thumbnail images for folders.
Logs,*.log,"The * is a wildcard. This ignores any file ending in .log. Logs are usually generated while a program runs and change constantly, making them ""noise"" in your Git history."
